# MS Teams Client

At Seatti we ship a Microsoft Teams App that enables users to plan and share their workspace location. This enables companies to manage their real estate resources as well as teams to organise their collaboration.

The MVP consists of two views, **Planning** and **Dashboard**, which are both Tabs in the Microsoft Teams App. Download this repository to start contributing!
